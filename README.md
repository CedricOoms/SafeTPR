# SafeTPR by Cedric
Minecraft plugin that implements a random teleporter sign which avoids teleporting players near other players or hostile mobs.

# Usage
Place any mincraft sign and write [TPR] (all caps) on the first line. You'll be notified if the sign was created correctly and the color of '[TPR]' changes to blue.
If this is indeed the case, the sign is ready to be used by clicking it with either hand.
